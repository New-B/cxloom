# CXLoom

CXLoom is a research prototype for a software-coherent CXL shared-memory system and a distributed thread runtime built on top of it.

The codebase is split into two peer subsystems:

- `LoomMem`: shared-memory allocation, global addressing, software coherence, versioning, local replicas, and CXL-resident queues
- `LoomPar`: distributed thread create/join, placement, barrier, lifecycle management, and memory-aware execution

## Repository Layout

- `include/cxloom/common`: shared types, config, status, message definitions
- `include/cxloom/loommem`: LoomMem public interfaces
- `include/cxloom/loompar`: LoomPar public interfaces
- `src/common`: shared runtime helpers
- `src/loommem`: LoomMem implementations
- `src/loompar`: LoomPar implementations
- `examples`: small integration drivers
- `docs`: design and implementation notes

## Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

## Current Status

This repository currently contains a compile-ready architecture skeleton. Most distributed and coherence operations intentionally return `Unimplemented` so we can fill them in step by step while keeping module boundaries stable.

## C API

C applications include `cxloom/cxloom.h` and use the short `cl_` prefix. The first
usable C API is the standalone LoomMem allocation interface:

```c
#include <cxloom/cxloom.h>

cl_runtime_t *runtime = NULL;
cl_gptr_t object;
cl_runtime_create(&config, &runtime);
cl_mem_alloc(runtime, 4096, 64, &object);
cl_mem_free(runtime, object);
cl_runtime_destroy(runtime);
```

`cl_gptr_t` is a global offset-based handle, not a process-local virtual
address. Future `cl_mem_*_acquire/release` calls will resolve it safely for
read and write access under LoomMem's coherence rules.
